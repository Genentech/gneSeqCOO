\title{COO Normalization function}
\usage{
coo_normalize(cds)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{\itemize{
\item a DESeqDataSet object, with raw counts in the "counts" slot.
}}
}
\value{
A normalized DESeqDataSet
}
\description{
The standard normalization function for RNASeq data
}
\details{
this function applies a robust library size normalization procedure
to the raw count matrix provided. The goal is to specifically ensure that
the expression values for the data are on a consistent scale, regardless
of the source dataset. For more details on the robust library size
normalization function, refer to the "COO_Classifier" supplemental
vignette.

Please note that rownames of the raw count matrix must be either refseq
IDs or ENSEMBL gene IDs. Gene symbols will not work.

Notably, for the purposes of machine learning, we do not care about the
absolute expression of genes, but only their expression relative to other
samples. This, combined with the fact that people may not know how to get
read lengths easily for new data means that we're skipping any
normalization step involving read length.
